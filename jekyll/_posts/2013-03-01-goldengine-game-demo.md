The above video is a recording of a prototype level made in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) by the students currently enrolled on the MSc Computer Games and Entertainment at Goldsmiths University. We are working on porting this level to our own engine, and then will attempt to build as close to a full game as possible within the time constraints of the course.

I am responsible for the sound design within the demo, and will also be recording and scripting sounds for the full game, as well as performing more general gameplay design and technical roles. This post will be updated as progress continues on the game, and more working examples will be shown.
