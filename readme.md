This is the source for my blog. It uses the static site generator [
jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate the html, and a bunch of patched-together node cli tools to do everything else.

## Getting Started

Install docker, docker-compose and yarn somehow.

## Production

```bash
yarn build
```

## Development

```bash
yarn watch
```

## Deployment

```bash
yarn deploy --prod
```
